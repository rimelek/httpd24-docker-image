Welcome to rimelek/httpd24 Docker image's documentation!
========================================================

Have you heard about `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ (Container engine)? Well, if you ever had problem with installing
dependencies on the same machine for different projects, you should. If you need an `Apache HTTPD <https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/>`_
web server, you can run it in seconds if you have Docker installed on your machine.

Unfortunately, you almost always need to customize it and create a new image with your own configuration.
Just think of the need of `PHP FPM <https://hub.docker.com/_/php/>`_ or other modules disabled by default.
This documentation is about an enhanced version of the HTTPD 2.4 image inherited from the official version.
It provides a way to customize the configuration by environment variables. PHP FPM configuration was the first reason
of creating this Docker image but now it is just an option among many.
