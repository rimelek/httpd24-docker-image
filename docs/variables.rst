Environment variables
=====================

Some variables have boolean values. Those values can be set various ways.

| Valid values for **true**: "true", "1", "on", "yes"
| Valid values for **false**: "false", "0", "off", "no"

Each of them is case insensitive.

Variables
---------

SRV_ADMIN
    (default: "you@example.com") "ServerAdmin" directive's value.
SRV_ALLOW_OVERRIDE
    (default: "false") Set it to "true" to enable overriding some configuration from .htaccess. See SRV_ENABLE_MODULE to enable rewrite module.
SRV_AUTH
    (default: "false") Set this to "true" if you need HTTP Basic authentication using an htpasswd file.
    Without SRV_AUTH_USERS you need to create the htpasswd file manually.
SRV_AUTH_NAME
    (default: "Private Area") This is the value of AuthName directive.
SRV_AUTH_USERS
    | (default: "") Set the users and their passwords line by line where the user and the password are separated by only one space.
    | Example:
    | SRV_AUTH_USERS="admin1 secretpassword\\
    | admin2 secretpassword2"
SRV_DOCROOT
    (default: "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs") The value after DocumentRoot directive. This variable helps you change the document root and it's Directory block.
SRV_ENABLE_CONFIG
    (default: "") Pass the name of configurations you want to enable separated by space. There are 3 type of configuration.

    * Official configuration files in "conf/extra" directory. The name of them starts with the name of configuration and ends with ".conf".
      For example: httpd-default.conf. SRV_ENABLE_CONFIG="httpd-default httpd-ssl" will enable httpd-default.conf and httpd-ssl.conf. You will rarely need it.
    * Custom configurations of rimelek/httpd24. These are in "conf/custom-extra" directory.
      To enable these configurations you would need to prefix them with "@". Example: SRV_ENABLE_CONFIG="@php" These are controlled by environment variables so you don't need to enable them this way.
    * Your custom configuration can be saved to "conf/custom-extra/user" directory. If you want to enable them, prefix the configuration names with "@user/".
      Example: SRV_ENABLE_CONFIG="@user/my-conditional-redirect". Of course, the filename must ends with ".conf". See SRV_DISABLE_CONFIG to disable configurations.
SRV_ENABLE_MODULE
    | (default: "") Just like SRV_ENABLE_CONFIG, but this is to enable modules like rewrite.
    | Example: SRV_ENABLE_MODULE="rewrite dav ssl"
    | To disable modules enabled by default use SRV_DISABLE_MODULE.
SRV_DISABLE_CONFIG
    | (default: "") Disable configurations enabled by default. It will comment out the configuration's include.
    | Example: SRV_DISABLE_CONFIG="proxy-html"
SRV_DISABLE_MODULE:
    | (default: "") If you want to disable every module you don't really need, this variable is for you.
    | Example: SRV_DISABLE_MODULE="autoindex"
SRV_LOGLEVEL
    (default: "warn") The server's log level
SRV_NAME
    (default: "localhost.localdomain") To change ServerName directive's value.
SRV_PHP
    (default: "false") If it is "true", requested PHP scripts will be sent to PHP FPM. PHP FPM's hostname is "php" by default.
    In the same docker network you can name the PHP container as "php" or use "php" as the name of Docker Compose service.
    You can customize the hostname by SRV_PHP_HOST.
SRV_PHP_DISABLE_REUSE
    (default: "true") When you upgrade the PHP container, the container's IP can change. To make sure HTTPD use the new IP to connect,
    you need to set "disablereuse=on" for FCGI proxy. To turn it off, set this variable's value to "true". You can use "on" and "off" too.
SRV_PHP_HOST
    (default: "php") The hostname of your PHP FPM service.
SRV_PHP_PORT
    (default: 9000) The port number of PHP FPM service.
SRV_PHP_TIMEOUT
    (default: "60") PHP FPM proxy timeout in seconds. When you want to use XDebug or other debug tools, or your PHP scripts
    running too long, you may want to increase the timeout.
SRV_PROXY_FORWARD_FROM
    (default: "/") You can use HTTPD as a reverse proxy to proxy some requests to another website.
    By default, all requests will be forwarded. You can change it, if you want:
    SRV_PROXY_FORWARD_FROM="/admin/"
SRV_PROXY_FORWARD_TO:
    (default: "") If it is not an empty string, httpd will forward all requests from SRV_PROXY_FORWARD_FROM to the given URL.
SRV_PROXY_PROTOCOL
    (default: "false") Behind a reverse proxy HTTPD will log the proxy's IP address and your PHP scripts need to check
    X-Forwarded-For or X-Client-Ip headers to determine the client IP. The
    `Proxy Protocol <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_remoteip.html#remoteipproxyprotocol>`_ helps you avoid it.
SRV_REVERSE_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER
    (default: "X-Forwarded-For") In case of reverse proxy front of the HTTPD, this is the HTTP header in which the proxy
    stores the real client IP. When SRV_REVERSE_PROXY_DOMAIN is set, you can see the real IP in server log.
SRV_REVERSE_PROXY_DOMAIN
    (default: "") If it is not empty, it can be an alternative to the proxy protocol. If you cannot use proxy protocol
    or you don't want to, you can tell httpd the domain, IP or IP range of the reverse proxy server.
    Example: SRV_REVERSE_PROXY_DOMAIN="haproxy" or SRV_REVERSE_PROXY_DOMAIN="10.42.0.0/16"
SRV_SSL
    (default: "false") Whether you need SSL or not. You can set it to "true" and httpd will look for the SSL private key
    and certificate. To tell HTTPD where those files are, see SRV_SSL_CERT and SRV_SSL_NAME.
SRV_SSL_AUTO
    (default: "false") In case of "true", the container will generate a self-signed certificate for you before starting the server.
    Note that it can take some minutes and won't be valid. Use it only for testing purposes.
SRV_SSL_CERT
    (default: "/usr/local/apache2/ssl/${CERT_NAME}.crt") The path of the ssl certificate inside the container.
    If you set SRV_SSL_LETSENCRYPT to "true" it will change the value of SRV_SSL_CERT to "/etc/letsencrypt/live/${CERT_NAME}/fullchain.pem".
SRV_SSL_KEY
    (default: "/usr/local/apache2/ssl/${CERT_NAME}.key") The path of the SSL private key file inside the container.
    If you set SRV_SSL_LETSENCRYPT to "true" it will change the value of SRV_SSL_CERT to "/etc/letsencrypt/live/${CERT_NAME}/privkey.pem".
SRV_SSL_LETSENCRYPT
    (default: "false") In case of "true", it changes the the value of SRV_SSL_CERT and SRV_SSL_KEY to be compatible with Let's Encrypt.
SRV_SSL_NAME
    (default: "ssl") The default SSL certificate is /usr/local/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt and the private key file is /usr/local/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt.
    You can change the file name by setting changing the value of this variable:

    | Example: SRV_SSL_NAME="custom"
    | Then the file names will be changed to custom.crt and custom.key


There are some other variables too just to be compatible with other docker containers like `Nginx Proxy <https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy>`_.

VIRTUAL_HOST
    Nginx proxy and `Hosts gen <https://hub.docker.com/r/rimelek/hosts-gen/>`_ use this to determine the domain name of the containers.
    If you set this variable and SRV_SSL_NAME, CERT_NAME, SRV_NAME are not set, it can be used to set the name of ssl certificate.
    See SRV_SSL_CERT and SRV_SSL_KEY.
CERT_NAME
    Nginx Proxy use this variable to choose the SSL certificate for the backend container if the certificate's name is not the same as the domain.
